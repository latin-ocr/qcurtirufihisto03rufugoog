xii Introduction.

hard to make their own. —intro muros .· cf. interfluebat, above. -
nomen .· tle. Marsyas. -ats a stronger adversative than ceterum,
here, as we see, contrasting the course within and that without
the walls. - maiore: do not fail to see the emphasis and notice the
turn it gives t0 the thought. ¹ The author has said fluit of the early
course; then evolvit, as if it had gathered strength by being pent
up in the city; and finally maiore vi, so much so as to make it a
different river-oi ac mole .· the Latin likes to combine two such
words, either of which would be sufficient and which in fact over-
lap each other, t0 express a single idea from two points of view, as
here oi expresses the force of the current, mole the quantity of
water—agentem undar: this participial phrase must of course
belong to the river, and the reader will notice that the Latin likes
to omit a pronoun if there is any adjective or other modifier to
suggest the form omitted. The reader must notice the fondness
of the language for participia} constructions to express all sorts of
circumstances (read Gr. ἕ 292). Here the participle is equiva-
lent to ‘now that it‚’ etc. The expression is a rather poetical
one according with the style of this writer.

ό. Alexander: a return, evidently, to the narrative after the
digressive description. The subject is emphasized to let the reader
know this. - quidem : the reader will have already found this one
of the untranslatable particles so frequent in Latin, but he may
be sure that it serves as a guide-post to an antithesis which is
always more or less important to the sense. It may have another
guide·post at the other end, as it were, ashere‚ or this may be ’
omitted, but it is sure to say ‘look out for an antithesis! This
should be between the word quidem follows and something else,
but here the fondness os the Latin for setting off persons, and
a confused idea of an antithesis between Alexander and other
assailants, transfers the antithesis from urbem and arcem, where
it naturally belongs, to the entire statements, though arcem is
sufficiently emphasized by vero, and urbem by its position retains
something of its proper prominence.-urbem‚ eto: one reading
