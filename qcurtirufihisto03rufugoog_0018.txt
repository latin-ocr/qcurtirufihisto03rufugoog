Introduction. xiii

1n the regular order must pay no regard to intrat, but take in the

words regardless of the final predicate, and read as if the idea oi
finds followed, which idea is, inLatin, implied. The Latin likes to
crowd two statements into one, as here, — ‘ finds the city deserted
and so goes in without opposition, but the citadel he has to assail;
before doing this, however, he summons it to surrender? : the result
isglven in the following. -dennntiarets the mood at once shows
that it means not ‘who did,’ but ‘who should ’ 3 ie. ‘to announce’
lhe force of the preposition, as is usual with that kind of word, is
difficult to define, but may be seen by careful examination: the
heralds are not only to report (nuntiare), but to lay officially
before them (cf. de ero) the formal demand of Alexander, which
amounts to a threat. - ni dederent: as this is already determined
to be indirect discourse, the verb must stand for ni ded'tz's, ni
dedetis, orni dedatis. Which of the three, really makes no differ-
ence, and is only a grammatica} question, the true relation of the
’ sentence as a firture protasis and apodosis is at once determined.
-‘ Yon shall unless yon dol-ipsos .· the word itself opposes the
men to some one or something else, which is obviously here
nothing but the citadel 3 ie. not only would he destroy that, but
would put them to death (the only meaning that ultima could
naturally have, even if the reader does not know that the phrase
is a euphemism for torture and death). ’
Such notes might be extended indefinitely, but enough has been
said to show the method recommended,-a method which, in some
form or other, consciously or unconsciously‚ is, it seems to me,
indispensable for a real knowledge of any foreign tongue.
