Inter ltoec: naturally referring to the transactions of the pre·
ceding book. For our purpose it is not at all necessary to know
what But we may be sure the expression means, ‘while this was
going on,’ ‘meanwhile.’-Alexaneler: evidently opposed to the
person or persons engaged in the transactions referred to.—od
conducendum: obviously the purpose of some action (see Gr.
ἕ 300), and probably one of Alexander's. The meaning of the word ·
has a very wide range, and if the student has not learned to read
rapidly enough to take in the whole context, he can only have a
vague notion of the meaning. He will naturally take the idea of
‘get together‚' or ‘get up‚’ but he must beon his guard against
settling upon any of the English translations given in his diction-
ary. These almost invariably follow English courses of thought,
and will in nine cases out 0f ten mislead. Some such tentative

lf he is only reading for the history, such a more exact idea he
will find perhaps unnecessary‚ as his vague meaning will do, but
ordinarily at this stage he needs more than that- Cleandro .· this ·
word may be either dative or ablative‚ but as the relations in which
persons stand are oftener denoted by the dative, it is more likely
to be dative. Yet the ablative absolute isso commendas mas
