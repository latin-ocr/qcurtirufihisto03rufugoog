vi Introduction

trained under this system that never look at a passage of Greek
or Latin without translating it first into English before trying to
see what it means. The idea of those who wished to reform this

state of things was that all information should be used as fast as it
was acquired aud in the very act of acquirement, and that the
pupil should be forced to think in the forms and order of the
foreign tongue. This is really all there is of it. Apupil should

begin from the start to try to read straight away, as if the language
were his own, to see what mental pictures the author meant to
’ present to himself, and only then, if necessary at all, transfer
the thought to an English form of expression. Translation is the
most convenient means for the student to satisfy himself or others
that he understands, but beyond this itis an absolute hindrance
to the study of a language. If a boy continues to think the
English into the Latin, he isjust so far prevented from seeing what
the author, who did not have any English ideas, really meant to
say. He must follow the foreign forms of thought and grammar
and the order of ideas, or he cannot leam these forms, this order,
or these ideas. The only way to learn to do a thing is to do it.
It is for the purpose of affording material for the necessary prac-
tice that this book has been prepared. The reader is supposed
to have acquired in some way (preferably by use) a knowledge
of the ordinary forms and constructions of the language, and a
vocabulary of the commonest words To show how he is then to
proceed Ι have taken a few passages from the beginning of the
book and followed exactly the processes which it seems to me
the reader ought to follow. It makes little difference whether he
translates or not, if he takes the meaning in first without translating3
but this is the essential thing: that the words should present their
ideas in the order in which they occur and with as little interme-
diate English coloring as possible at the stage of advancement of
the reader.

Taking the first passage of the book, he may proceed as is
indicated in the following notes : -
