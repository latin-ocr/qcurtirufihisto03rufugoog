As the subject of Reading at Sight is one in which Ι have long
been interested, Ι write at the request of my friend, Dr. F owler, an

difference is merely in the order of attainment and the use of·
knowledge when attained. Formerly, it used to be supposed in

must be learned before the student could begin to read, and as
such a knowledge is almost, if not quite, impossible, very few
persons ever began to read at all. They knew a great deal about
the language, and after having learned a passage they could do
something towards putting it into English, the language in which

to his own mind when he wrote. I know some encellent scholars
