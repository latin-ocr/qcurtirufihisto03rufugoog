either accusative plural or nominative or ablative singular ‚femi-
nine. But as it cannot very well agree with tempestate, it is
more likely to be accusative. Its emphatic position suggests
no idea to us, neither at the present stage need it trouble us.—
illa tempestate: the ablative oi a word that refers to time nat·
urally expresses the time when. The meaning of the word as here
employed is probablya new one. From meaning reason it has
come to have the meaning of tempus, from which it is a derivative
(abstract). This one could almost guess, and the dictionary will
confirm the conjecture—moenia .· when we come to this, it ob
viously settles media as its attribute, and the position oi the two
naturally refers them to the city Celaenae just mentioned. thether
the words are subject or object makes absolutely no difference at
present. From the nature os the case, acity regarded as enclosed
in walls, which moenia must mean here, can only have practically
one relation: it must be something or have something done to it,
in both of which phases it is essentially passive-interfluebat:
’ the relation is now settled. The city is now seen to be ⁴ flowed

next phrase. -fabulosis : an adjective modifying some ablative
of manner, meanS, or instmment, because names of things naturally
stand in that relation, and there is no reason to expect any name
of persons, and besides persons have ordinarily prepositional con-
structions. - Graecorum .· belonging to the noun with which our
adjective must agree-carminibus.- the character of this noun
confirms our supposition of its relation as an ablative oi means or
the like, and inclitas compleres the adjunct describing our river.
As to the words, the only troublesome one is fabulaszs; but our
knowledge of the force of the termination osus ought, is we avoid
the English borrowed word ‘sabulous’ (a caution such as must
always be taken), to show us the meaning ‘full oi marvellous stories.¹
3. Fons, etc.: these words read of themselves, if we only have
patience to hold on to the phrase ex summo, etc, denotinga ‘place
whence,' until we have a word oi mot‘mn,cacarrcas,m anamm-
