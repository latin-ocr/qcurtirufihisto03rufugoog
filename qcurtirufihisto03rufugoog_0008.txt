PREFACE.

—m— ῃ

This edition of the first two extant books—of Quintus
Curtius (probably the third and fourth books of the orig-
inal work) is intended for use in the upper classes of
preparatory schools and the lower classes of colleges.
At the foot of each page such words and uses ot words
are given as cannot reasonably be expected to be familiar
to those who have studied Latin only three or four years.
It is hoped that some waste of time in the class-room
may thus be avoided.

The text is adopted without change from Vogel's edi·
tion, Leipsic, 1884
