Introduction. xi

us, he can use the expression also of ¹the imaginations of the poets,
as here-quippe: if the pupil has forgotten this word from his
Virgil he must find it out as in previous cases. If a teacher
gives the meaning, he should give it in some form that will instmct
· the boy for future occurrences of the same word. If the boy
looks it up in the dictionary, he should run through the article
and see what general idea the word presented to a Roman.—
traditum est: the neuter of the participle, as well as the emphatic
position of the verb taken in connection with the preceding, sug-
gests an impersonal idea like, there is a trazdtzhn (obviously the
mendacium of the poets).—nymplras: with what precedes, this
must be the subject of an indirect discourse construction con-

refinements as this the Latin naturally distinguishes, not as reline-
ments, but because the order of the words is a perfect mirror of
the prominence of ideas.

indicates a slight contrast between the foregoing and the fol-
lowing, often no more than the contrast of anew subject of
discourse, like our now, as here.·—quamdiu: a relative word,
and therefore requiring an antecedent. But it is to be remem-
bered that this ‘antecedent' often follows and often is not
expressed at all. ‘Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him
declare I unto you ¹ and ‘Do what you can' are the types of Latin
relative clauses more common than any others. An as long must
have (to our minds) a so long to match it, and this so belongs in
the main clause. This is elementary lore, but most boys find it
