x Introduction.

The same patience must be exercised with ‘the place to which ’
in subiectam petram. This last word is new, and not Latin, but
borrowed. Its meaning must be got by any means that we have.—
magno strepitu: obviously denoting, from the nature of the
words, the manner or accompanying circumstance of the action.
-aquarume this word limiting strepitu would seem to us at
first unnecessary, as the noise of the fall is sufficiently indicated
without it. But languages and even writers differ much in
their use of individual words. Fons includes the water but does
not necessarily impress the idea upon us, and hence aquarum
is added beside. In English we should say, in a nothy cascadc.
-cadit.· the whole picture can represent nothing but a stream
falling from a height into a rocky basin, and we are ready to go
on.—inde: after falling into the basim-dtffusus: naturally
the force of das can only be that the water spreads from its retaining
rocks into a wide and shallow stream—ragat: (cf. nugata)-
suas,· the emphatic position opposes the waters of the river to
tributaries which might make them turbid-dumtaxat: in later
writers is used with the force of modo.

in a connection where we should not use that figure, though it is
perfectly intelligihle‚ but should say, ‘given a chance‚’ or ‘an
opportunity‚' or ‘occasion’ But always see first just what the
Roman said to himself before you undertake to say the like thing
to your English beares-mendacio: the reader will know (or
find out) that this word corresponds to our word ‘lying'; but
he can hardly help seeing also that it does not exactly corre·
spond, but that its meaning is free from the suggestion of wrong
which that word has in English. He will therefore translate it
by ‘fiction’ or some similar word which does not contain that
suggestion. Such differences should be noticed‚ and the pupil
should not be content with picking out from a string of synonymes
given in the dictionary one which seems to suit. The author really
says ‘lying’ 3 but as that was not so reprehensible as it is with
