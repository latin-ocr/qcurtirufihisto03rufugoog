viii Introduction.

possibility must not be forgotten. The two possibilities must be
remembered and carried on. The ieamer can now go back and
see what he has got so far: ‘The time, the subject, the purpose,
the place from which, and theman who acts or to whom some-
thing is done.’-cum pecunia .· this phrase settles almost certainly
the case os Cleandro ,· sor though it might be cum pecunia agrum
dedit or the like, yet the immediate connection of the phrase with
the name indicates a close relation between them. Hence we
suspect the ablative absolute—misso .· this word clinches our con-
clusion, and we can see that the whole is a subordinate branch
of the main action ascribed to Alexander. The purpose is now
seen to belong to the action of oozsso, and we have the idea ‘that
Alexander sent Cleander with money to hire troops from Pelopon-
nesus,’ but the main action still remains unknown—Lyciae:
this word evidently begins a new brooch, and must almost cer-
tainly be in the genitive, being the name ofa country of which
no relation would naturally be expressed here by ¹the dative.-
rebus: the governing word os the two genitives, and not possibly
anything but ablative absolute from the nature of the idea ex·
pressed.-conposiu's: forming the keystone of the new arch, which
we see stands on a line with Cleandro masso—od urbem, etc:
plainly enough the final action of Alexander, and completing the
whole in the regular Roman form. It is worth while to notice that
the place to which Alexander goes is opposed (by emphatic posi-
tion) to the places whose affairs he first sets i⁹n order. The key to
the meaning of all Latin prose is found in the arrangement os the
words, by which phrases, antitheses, immediate connections, and
all kinds of modes of thought are indicated with great exactness.
Now is the purpose of the reading be to leam to read Latin, it is
well to look back and see what usages we have come to which are
presumably new or at least not so very common, -the technical
meaning of conducere, the collective use of miles, and the anti-
thetic position os opposed words.
